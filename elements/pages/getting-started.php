      <p>If you are eager to try Leaf out before the official release it's totally fine to download <i>this</i> project (including all php-files + project specific css).<br /><br />

      Also! Feel free to contribute. I appreciate all the help that I can get. Feedback on this project is also very helpful.

      <h2>Respect Google and their work</h2>
      <p>Listen up. I love what google does and am myself a huge fan of their work. Please notice this is just the start of Leaf CSS Framework and much will change until the final release.
      </p>
  
      <h3>You may ask, why did you reveal it when it is far from done?</h3>
      <p>
      First of, my intention wasn't to get the attraction that Leaf got (over one day). I just posted a link to get some responses and BANG, all over the internet.
      <br />
      Secondly, people already blaming Leaf for being a "poor implementation". It's in its alpha and if you got good ideas and inputs, why not contribute? A project gotta start somewhere. Also, I think it's appropriate to share Leaf this early in the progression. I'm no designer, though I love beautiful designs and interfaces, and therefore I find it important to get others inputs before setting standards.
      </p>

      <h2>Read this if you are thinking about contributing</h2>
      <p>The idea is pretty simple. Just copy everything as good as possible from <a href="http://google.com/design/spec" target="_blank">Google's material design</a> and make CSS/JS out of it.
      The goal is to move everything from there to the web, easy to use and maintain.
      <br /><br />
      ~ I've chosen to go with <a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/" target="_blank">Stylus</a> as the projects pre-processor. So a good start is to accept that faith :)
      <br />
      ~ I'm running <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/" target="_blank">Codekit</a> to compile all of the .styl's and .coffee's, but you can set up a grunt if you feel like.
      <br />
      ~ <i>This project</i> is based on <a href="http://gettopbot.eu" target="_blank">Topbot</a> which is really easy to understand and use.
      <br />
      ~ In /leaf (from project root) you'll find everything that will be in the final release, here's were you want to but your code.
      </p>
      <h2>Most importantly</h2>
      <p>Nothing is set. The idea is clear, but the final product is not decided. If you contribute to this project you'll have your name on it upon release and beyond.
      <br /><br />
      <i class="icon icon-leaf text-green"></i> will always be free to use and hopefully it will be seen as the new <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter bootstrap</a> for smartphones and tablets one day.
      <br /><br />
      Cheers to Google for setting beautiful standards to interfaces! Amen.
